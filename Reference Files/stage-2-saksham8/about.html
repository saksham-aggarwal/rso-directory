        <div class="card">
            <p>This web applications will cater to students need such as - </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1) finding cheap but good quality groceries</li>
                    <li>2) storage space for out-of-state students while they go out on vacation or move-out of the dorms</li>
                    <li>3) updates about events organized by various departments numerous student organization</li>
                </ul>
            <p>The reason I want to develop such applications is that I personally as a student find it really hard to keep track of
                the events going around campus since each department and student organization post updates about their events either on
                the departmental website or Facebook. Also, every student wants to save money while in college and try to find places where
                they could get cheap groceries at affordable prices. Moreoever, out-of-state students living on campus usually find it very 
                hard to find space to store their belongings over summer break so I think that developing an application (similar to Airbnb)
                could be useful. Another useful add-on application on this web portal is the "NoProcrastinate" which has the ability to restrict
                access to websites which students don't want to visit while they are working on their homework or studying for an exam.

            <h2 class="card-title">Finding Cheap Groceries</h2>
            <p>So far, there are no such applications which could provide the client with such information. Also, this will be very
                beneficial to college students which could help them save some extra money.In this applications, rates for all items 
                will be picked up from all the nearby grocery stores and compared to give the lowest price and the location of the 
                store. A user can choose the item they want to purchase and then the app will show up the store, its location and 
                the price offered. This information will be chosen based on the lowest price of the item.

            <h2 class="card-title">Storage Space Locator</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this application is to help out-of-state and international students who live on campus to find space to
            store their stuff when they need to move-out of the dorms at the end of the academic year. In this application, there
            will be two clients - </p>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Storage space provider</li>
                <li>Storage space utilizer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The provider will have to create an account along with uploading pictures of the space and the dimensions which could give
            the utilizer a good idea about whether their stuff would fit in that space. Also, the provider will be asked for how much
            price they expect for the space and then the web application would calcuate the final price. Prior to posting the price, 
            the provider will be asked for whether they agree with the price. This price will be calculated based on a certain formula
            (TBD). On the other hand, the utilizer will be able to search for such storage spaces, compare prices and finally book the 
            space for the duration entered by the utilizer.

        <div class="card">
            <h2 class="card-title">Event Manager for Campus Events</h2>
            <p>This applications will be developed for helping the students keep track of the events organized all around the campus whether
            it is organized by a specific department like CSE, Informatics, Business School or a student organization. Moreover, events 
            hosted by the career center such as career fairs, resume review workshop and many others will be listed on the application.
            The layout of the application would be like a calendar (similar to Apple calendar) and all the events and their information
            could be viewed at one place. There could also a remainder feature which the users can utilize to alert them about the events.
