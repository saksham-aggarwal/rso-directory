                <p>
                  An RSO, or Registered Student Organization, is the organization that encompasses all student
                  clubs and societies on campus. This part of campus essentially play a huge role in the social
                  life on campus, as students often find their friend groups through societies and clubs. These 
                  organizations can be anything from a fraternity, to chess club, to the National Society of Black
                  Enginners. So these organizations can have a varying role and responsibility, whether it provides
                  housing, career opportunities, a place to celebrate culture, or a place where students can practice
                  their passions. These organizations shape our campus, it affects student wellness and relationships.
                  We want our students to feel like they belong on this campus, and feel like we provide all of our students
                  with a place to pursue their passions and interests. Here is a video from UW students that can offer 
                  an insight into the role of an RSO on campus:

                <p>
                  UW provides <a href="https://uws-community.symplicity.com/index.php?au=&amp;ck=">an RSO directory,</a> intended
                  for students looking for clubs, societies and campus activities. However, the tool is very outdated, one look at
                  the site shows that it was created a while back. It is not consistent at all with other, more modern, UW
                  pages on their site. Not updating the site shows a clear disregard for student societies, and their wellness,
                  as student participation on campus is integral to the college experience. The site is not very intuitive, 
                  and does not promote social or campus activity.

                    <p>The current design and layout of the site is old, and needs to be revamped to be more intuitive
                        and easier to use. The current design does not encourage student participation.

                    <p>
                      There is currently no social media on the RSO directory, which seems counter-intuitive,
                      as one of the biggest purposes of RSOs is to promote social activity and meeting others.
                      The current solution offers no way for students to meet others through the application.

                    <p>
                      There is a lack of organization in the current RSO directory, their search system 
                      makes it hard for people to filter by interests, and the only one you can find 
                      a specific organization is by listing all of them. If you know what you are looking for,
                      then you are in for a hard time.

                  Our take of the RSO directory, as described above in <A href="#RSOSection">the above section</A> includes an optimized searching algorithm, where anyone can filter 
                  by interests, hours, activities, categories, etc. We aim to empower each student to pursure their passions
                  with our application, helping them find a place they belong to on campus. We also promote collaboration
                  between students, allowing them a way to communicate and keep in touch with other students they meet through
                  RSOs. Amongst other new features, we aim to have intuitive and modern organization and site map that will 
                  seem fitting for our young, and technology-experienced demographic of college students.

                      We understand that it is hard to find the club that you belong to in a sea of societies, especially in a campus
                      like UW, that is home to more than 40 thousand students. For that reason, we offer a searching algorithm that 
                      caters to you and your needs, whatever sort of passion, interests, type of club, even size of club you are looking for,
                      we will help you find it, using a filtering algorithm that lets you discover where you belong.
